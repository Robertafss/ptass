      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                                 Apache License
                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall meane delimited by an opening curly brace (`{`), a style, some content, and a closing curly brace (`}`).

Template styles are chained exactly like normal Chalk styles. The following three statements are equivalent:

```js
console.log(chalk.bold.rgb(10, 100, 200)('Hello!'));
console.log(chalk.bold.rgb(10, 100, 200)`Hello!`);
console.log(chalk`{bold.rgb(10,100,200) Hello!}`);
```

Note that function styles (`rgb()`, `hsl()`, `keyword()`, etc.) may not contain spaces between parameters.

All interpolated values (`` chalk`${foo}` ``) are converted to strings via the `.toString()` method. All curly braces (`{` and `}`) in interpolated value strings are escaped.

## 256 and Truecolor color support

Chalk supports 256 colors and [Truecolor](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728) (16 million colors) on supported terminal apps.

Colors are downsampled from 16 million RGB values to an ANSI color format that is supported by the terminal emulator (or by specifying `{level: n}` as a Chalk option). For example, Chalk configured to run at level 1 (basic color support) will downsample an RGB value of #FF0000 (red) to 31 (ANSI escape for red).

Examples:

- `chalk.hex('#DEADED').underline('Hello, world!')`
- `chalk.keyword('orange')('Some orange text')`
- `chalk.rgb(15, 100, 204).inverse('Hello!')`

Background versions of these models are prefixed with `bg` and the first level of the module capitalized (e.g. `keyword` for foreground colors and `bgKeyword` for background colors).

- `chalk.bgHex('#DEADED').underline('Hello, world!')`
- `chalk.bgKeyword('orange')('Some orange text')`
- `chalk.bgRgb(15, 100, 204).inverse('Hello!')`

The following color models can be used:

- [`rgb`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model) - Example: `chalk.rgb(255, 136, 0).bold('Orange!')`
- [`hex`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet) - Example: `chalk.hex('#FF8800').bold('Orange!')`
- [`keyword`](https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords) (CSS keywords) - Example: `chalk.keyword('orange').bold('Orange!')`
- [`hsl`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) - Example: `chalk.hsl(32, 100, 50).bold('Orange!')`
- [`hsv`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) - Example: `chalk.hsv(32, 100, 100).bold('Orange!')`
- [`hwb`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HWB_color_model) - Example: `chalk.hwb(32, 0, 50).bold('Orange!')`
- [`ansi`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3/4_bit) - Example: `chalk.ansi(31).bgAnsi(93)('red on yellowBright')`
- [`ansi256`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit) - Example: `chalk.bgAnsi256(194)('Honeydew, more or less')`

## Windows

If you're on Windows, do yourself a favor and use [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) instead of `cmd.exe`.

## Origin story

[colors.js](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js) used to be the most popular string styling module, but it has serious deficiencies like extending `String.prototype` which causes all kinds of [problems](https://github.com/yeoman/yo/issues/68) and the package is unmaintained. Although there are other packages, they either do too much or not enough. Chalk is a clean and focused alternative.

## chalk for enterprise

Available as part of the Tidelift Subscription.

The maintainers of chalk and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies you use.

bug that resulted in a false positive error when validating type compatibility between two functions with nested Concatenate and ParamSpec usage.
    -   Bug Fix: Fixed a bug in the code flow graph relating to "with" statements that are nested within a "try" statement when the context manager does not swallow exceptions but instead forwards them to the outer except clause.
    -   Enhancement: Improved error message for binary and unary operations when an expected type (bidirectional inference) is present.
    -   Bug Fix: Fixed a performance issue that caused long analysis times for some code flow graphs that involve deeply nested loops and many interdependent variables.
    -   Bug Fix: Fixed a bug that resulted in a false positive error when assigning a value of type `type | Any` to type `type[T]`.
    -   Bug Fix: Fixed a bug that resulted in false positive errors when assigning a value to class variable that contains a generic descriptor object.
    -   Enhancement: Improved the error message for a call expression where a keyword argument and a positional argument target the same parameter.
    -   Enhancement: Updated typeshed stubs to the latest version.
-   [1.1.225](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/releases/tag/1.1.225)
    -   Bug Fix: Added missing checks for an attempt to modify a variable that has been marked "Final" using a means other than a simple assignment statement. This includes augmented assignments, tuple assignments, for statements, with statement
